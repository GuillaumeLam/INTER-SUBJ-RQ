Repo for research questions following up on the paper: 
[Generalizability of deep learning models for predicting outdoor irregular walking surfaces](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2022.111159)

TODO:

DATA:
- look into segmentation of gait cycles
- check weighting of number of gait cycles per terrain type

INTER-SUBJ-CALIB:
- replicate results of Shah et al. (2022)
- port prev models
- build bilinear model
- ...
- generate graph of acc of various model types vs number of training example of new subject

INTER-SUBJ-OOD:
- figure out model type
- ...
- generate graph of record-wise and subject-wise split acc per label
