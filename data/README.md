Place 'data.mat' from [link](https://springernature.figshare.com/collections/A_database_of_human_gait_performance_on_irregular_and_uneven_surfaces_collected_by_wearable_sensors/4892463) of the dataset from [A database of human gait performance on irregular and uneven surfaces collected by wearable sensors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0563-y)

and run in order: export_to_py.m then process_mat.py, to generate the numpy file of the data used for the research questions.
